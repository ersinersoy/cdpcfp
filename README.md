# Software Code Defect Prediction from Requirements: A Study Based on COSMIC Sizing Data Movements
This project is about a novel method for predicting code defect proneness at the requirement analysis phase by considering COSMIC Function Point (CFP) measurements for the first time. An industrial case study was performed in the context of a FinTech company that develops a system comprising a backend, a native iOS application, and a native Android application. We measured CFP during the requirements analysis phase of the corresponding project for all tasks over 12 months. 

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook and the dataset. Jupyter Notebook includes implementation of the proposed method and research questions of the related study. The research questions of the study listed below,
- *RQ1: Is there any correlation between CFP size and the number of code defects?*
- *RQ2: How does the correlation between CFP size and the number of code defects differ across various platforms, levels of developer seniority, and CFP data movement characteristics?*
- *RQ3: To what extent can we accurately predict the number of code defects for a new task?*
